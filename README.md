# 🌟 INFORMATION THEORY AND CODING LAB
Welcome to the Information Theory and Coding Lab repository! This project is dedicated to experiments, algorithms, and implementations in Information Theory and Coding — the backbone of data compression, error correction, and efficient communication systems in digital technology.

# 👤 ABOUT ME
I'm **Naimur Rahman 👨‍💻**, a student in the Department of **Information and Communication Engineering at Pabna University of Science and Technology**. This repository showcases my lab work and coding projects, covering both foundational algorithms and advanced topics in information theory. I hope to provide useful resources and examples to anyone eager to dive into this essential field of computer science and communication.

# 📁 REPOSITORY CONTENTS
The repository includes code implementations and explanations for:

# 🔸 Random Walks and Stationary Distributions: Calculations and analyses of long-term behaviors in random walks on graphs, which are key in network analysis, ranking algorithms, and much more.
🔸 Convolutional Coding: Convolutional encoding and decoding methods, with generator polynomial calculations and insights into error-correction capabilities.
🔸 Entropy and Information Calculations: Implementations for calculating entropy, joint entropy, mutual information, and other crucial information-theoretic metrics.
🔸 Error Detection and Correction Codes: Examples of error-correcting codes, including linear and Hamming codes, for reliable data transmission.
Each section is structured to make understanding and experimenting with information theory and coding concepts easy and practical.
